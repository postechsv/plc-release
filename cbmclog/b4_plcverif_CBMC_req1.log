   CLI version: 1.0.0.202012152221
--------------------------------------------
Arguments: benchmark/plcverif/cmd/workspace2/benchmark4/req1.vc3
Program directory: /home/jlee/plc-release/benchmark/plcverif/cmd
Warning: CBMC reported that the given requirement is satisfied. However, take into account that CBMC performs bounded model checking with a limited bound, thus it may not find violations which require many execution cycles to reach. [CBMC output parsing]
Warning: The settings element 'job.backend.dynamic' (value: true) has not been used. Maybe its name has a typo? [Reporting]

Requirement: *(not (instance.STACKEMPTY and instance.STACKFULL )) * is always true at the end of the PLC cycle.
             (AG (EoC --> (! (instance/STACKEMPTY && instance/STACKFULL))))

**Result: the requirement is SATISFIED**

Backend: CbmcBackend
Parameters:
